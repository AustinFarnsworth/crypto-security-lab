Part 3
Essay on data breach

The alibaba cyber breach that happened in 2019 was big enough that they got 1.1
billion pieces of user data. They were able to get unsernames, phone numbers and 
other info. None of it was sold but used for person services. It was stolen by a 
contractor of the chinese company. 

The two were sentenced to two years in jail and fines totaling $70,260. None of
the data was sold it was used to serve clients. The breach came from another shopping 
site owned by alibabe named Taobao. A deveoper there who was working on their software 
used a traching software to discreetly take and save customers data.

Alibaba realeased a statement saying “Taobao devotes substantial resources to combat 
unauthorized scraping on our platform, as data privacy and security is of utmost importance. 
We have proactively discovered and addressed this unauthorized scraping,” “We will continue 
to work with law enforcement to defend and protect the interests of our users and partners.”
